            Here you can see how the unconscious repeats the same dream theme even a year later, 
            when the problem behind the dream image is not addressed. Here I attempt to connect the dreams and 
            find the overarching meaning.

            <span className="yellow">20.04.2022</span> - I was in Japan in an elegant store and wanted to buy cigarettes. 
            There was a square in the center and 4 seats at the corners. By pressing a button we can lower the seat (like the villain in Pokémon 2). 
            An Asian man  came down from the seat and handed me a pack of cigarettes. I gave him 10€ but he told 
            me it wasn't enough. So I tried with 1000 czk but still no. I then told him that I wasn't going to 
            buy the package but he absolutely wanted me to pay for it. We had a falling out and then I left. 
            So a chase started with my 3 friends, we were chased by a kind of secret police. Two of my friends 
            were quickly caught and I managed to escape with the last one. We then found ourselves in my house in 
            Savoie which belonged to me. To get out, we slid against the walls but they were 10 meters high. 
            We were still being chased.
          </p>

          <p>
          <span className="yellow">11.04.2023</span> - Me and my girlfriend were going to meet midway on a street, for a drink. 
            When we met, she asked me if I had my wallet. I said yes. We entered a bar but it turned out 
            to be my grandparent's house . Inside, I asked the bartender 
            for two beers. He said it will be 30€ with an Italian accent. I found it weird but didn't really understand 
            at first (my mind was lost : did he mean 3 or 30?). I gave him a bill of 1000 czk  (green like the ones of 2000). 
            He went to the other room to find the change, the room in which my grandmother keeps her money. After some time, 
            I was so puzzled and realized the price. So I told Ana : « I won't pay 30€ for 2 beers ». I climbed the 
            stairs of the house, and the guy was closing a box on the wardrobe. He was so surprised to see me here that 
            he made a move to jump through the window. I screamed : « Ana, open the door ! » so that it could be 
            possible to catch him from outside but managed to catch him before he jumped. I woke up and my interpretation 
            was that he had a gun in the box.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="yellow">22.04.2023</span> - I was with Ana at my place in the bedroom. We heard a noise. A big man has opened the room's door. 
            I asked him who he was and he said that he was living here from today. He was saying that Ana shouldn't live 
            here, that it was illegal. I told him that she didn't live here (because she didn't). He went to the other room 
            that had completely changed. There was big furniture now in the room (a wardrobe, a table, he even put a clock 
            on the wall). I asked him who he was. He said that he was coming from North-East Italy, I thought that it must 
            be close to Slovenia. It seems that he wanted to live here so I was looking for my contract and I was trying 
            to call my landlord in order to make him understand that it wasn't possible (and I didn't want to live with him).

          <h2 className="yellow">Context</h2>

          <p>
            The dreamer is a male of 29. At the moment of the dreams he was in a relationship. He would experience frequent feelings 
            of emptiness and depression. The relationship was all over the place, where she would want stability, but he 
            would fluctuate, occasionally declaring they are not together. The dreamer would read about the
            {" "}<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puer_aeternus" className="yellow" target="_blank">Puer archetype</a>{" "}
            feeling that it describes him well.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="yellow">Interpretation</h2>

          <h3 className="yellow">First dream</h3>

          <p>
            The associations to Japan were: exciting and a different world, and to cigarettes that they make him feel 
            full when he is empty, but also that they are unhealthy and cause cancer. 
            So we may interpret that the dreamer is seeking a form of excitement, a means to fill 
            up emptiness that is unhealthy. Then there is a square and in the center 4 seats. The number four and 
            the square symbolize the idea of totality 
            the individual's wholeness. But then the seats are associated to a villain, so we can say that the dreamer is 
            confronted with a negative expression of the Self. The Self, the centering factor in the human personality can appear 
            in a negative form when the ego attitude is too contrary to that of the unconscious. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Then the asian man comes down and he hands the dreamer the cigarettes but the price to pay is very high. The 
            dreamer hands the asian man 10 euros, and then he hands him 40 euros in czech crown and it's still not sufficient. 
            It appears that no matter how much he pays for these cigarettes, it's not enough. 
          </p>

          <p>
            So the dreamer is trying to fill up his sense of emptiness in a way that is unhealthy, and the unconscious is 
            making him pay for it. Not only he ends up not getting the cigarettes, thus, not filling the emptiness, but he 
            ends up persecuted by the unconscious.
          </p>

          <h3 className="yellow">Second dream</h3>
          
          <p>
            The dreamer is meeting midway with his girlfriend. In relationship terms this would mean that they both 
            sacrifice equally for their relationship. She then asks him if he has his wallet, if he has money. Money in 
            a dream means libido. Then they enter a bar that turned out to be the grandparents house. The dreamer had very 
            positive associations to the grandparents house. When he was a boy, he would meet his grandmother after school and she would buy 
            him pokemon cards. In the present day he would often nostalgically return to those memories. 
          </p>

          <p>
            It is interesting then to note that the unconscious takes this image, the grandparents house, and gives to it 
            an ominous feeling. In the dream the house was dark and the italian man and overall atmosphere reminded him of 
            the italian mafia. This tells us that those lofty, beautiful feelings are hiding a mother complex. A hidden desire 
            to remain a child and avoid the responsibilities of adulthood. And here we see that when the dreamer takes his 
            relationship to such a place, the consequences are bad.
          </p>

          <p>
            The dreamer associated drinks with intimacy, because when you drink you open up and share a lot. So here he wants 
            to share a moment with his lover but the italian asks for 30 euros. But not only the drink is overpriced, the italian 
            tries to run away with the money. There is however a moment of insight when the dreamer chases the italian. Here the 
            italian is taken by surprise and attempts to jump out the window. What would this mean in psychological terms? That 
            at the moment when the dreamer is about to realize his error, he becomes unconscious again and keeps on acting under 
            the influence of the shadow figure with no recognition of his error. So the unconscious says: catch it before it runs 
            away. The dreamer wakes up before he catches the thief.
          </p>

          <h3 className="yellow">Third dream</h3>

          <p>
            The setting of this dream is an intimate moment with the partner. And here we meet again the italian man. This time 
            he is much more powerful than in the previous dream. He takes over the house, moves in, and declares the girlfriend 
            should not be here because she does not belong. That he takes over the house means that the dreamer is possessed by 
            this shadow figure. 
          </p>

          <h3 className="yellow">Synthesis</h3>

          <p>
            In the first dream, we have the theme of finding excitement, meaning and wholeness in an unhealthy way that is 
            punished by the unconscious. The punishment consists in asking the dreamer to pay for his behaviour a price that seems 
            untenable and the chase which represents psychic invasions that are usually neurotic behaviours. We know from the 
            life of the dreamer that he would frequently feel depressed and empty. The dreamer is thus trying to find meaning 
            without putting in the effort, easy like smoking a ciggy. 
          </p>

          <p>
            This tendency of looking for pleasure and meaning in easy ways and not put in the effort required from adult life appears 
            again in the second dream, where the beloved childhood house is shown in negative light by the unconscious. Here again the 
            unconscious steals from the dreamer. If the dreamer wants to have a meaningful and intimate relationship with his girlfriend, 
            he needs to grow up and leave behind the fantasy of the grandmother house where everything was perfect and sweet and there 
            were no adult responsibilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            The third dream is an amplification of what happened in the second dream. The italian was not caught. The dreamer did not 
            realize the consequence on his relationship of remaning infantile. The childhood dreams take over and the shadow 
            side grows proportionally bigger. The dreamer is now having doubts about his relationship and feels that it's perhaps 
            not what he wants. The dark side of the childhood fantasy is affecting not only the relationship but him as well. 
            He is no longer master of his own house.
