          <p>
            I was at my parent's place and I had to go to Paris probably to the airport, and from there to Prague (I was living there). 
            My parents left for holidays and I still haven't decided how to get there. I was very stressed about it 
            because there were so many ways to get there. So I was just waiting. Then I was with a group of people, 
            friends of my friends, they were playing poker and I was asking for help from them. They were trying to 
            help me by giving me solutions. Then my luggage was ready but I didn't have the pants I wanted so I had to 
            go back to my parent's place to pick them up.  
          </p>

          <p>
            I was with Ludmilla at my parent's place and then I heard the garage door, so I thought about hiding her but 
            I actually presented her as a friend. Then my mother came as well. We were in my room with Ludmilla and I was 
            rubbing against her. It was all very sensual but there were people outside (family) doing things. So when 
            we got out of the room, my mother said "be careful with the angles" meaning on what angle I'm doing stuff because 
            people outside could see me. She wasn't happy that I brought a girl home.

          <h2 className="red">Context</h2>

          <p>
            The dreamer is a male of 30. He is temporary living at his parents and he is about to meet his girlfriend with 
            whom he wants to rent a home.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="red">Associations:</h2>

          <p>
            <span className="red">parents place</span> - clean, a place i don't want to be in, i still feel at home tho. I don't have the same emotional connection to this house as other people. 
            It's not really my house.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="red">Paris</span> - University, my flat in Paris. Emotionally it's positive, I had my little rhythm, was going to the library, intellectual, artistic - close to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="red">Prague</span> - When I moved there, it was in the idea to get a job and be mature. Then I was with my girlfriend there too.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="red">luggage</span> - travelling, something annoying, I would like to travel with a backpack. 
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="red">pants</span> - something you wear, something that fits you. They need to fit well, more important than with shirts, to feel good, comfortable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="red">Ludmilla</span> - someone I played a sexual role with, which makes it rather fake.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="red">Interpretation first dream</h2>

          <p>
            The locale of the dream represents the current state of the dreamer. He is in a place he doesn't want to be in.
            Moreover, dreaming about the house we grew up in is indicative that in some way we are still infantile. Then he needs
            to go to Prague, which the dreamer associated to growing up, maturity, adulthood. Furthermore he associated the relationship
            with his partner which also presses him into stabilizing himself and acting more mature. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The dream then indicates that to get to Prague he must first go through Paris. In this way the unconscious is showing him
            that maturity is achieved not in spite of being one's own creative self, but through it. After discussing this with the dreamer,
            it was clear that he associates adulthood and responsibility to something dull and boring, so the unconscious is indicating
            that he should be integrating his creative self into the adulthood journey. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, the dreamer is in a state of confussion as to the ways in which he should get to Prague. For this he asks for the
            help of the poker players who give him good advice. The poker players represent an aspect of the dreamer that is able to
            exert emotional control when needed and to deal with difficult situations. This is meaningful because in his personal life the
            dreamer would sometimes get emotionally overwhelmed.
          </p>

          <p>
            He is then ready, however the end has a negative twist. After his luggage is finished, he realizes his pants are 
            missing and he goes back to the parental house to fetch them. This would translate into a tendency to go back to the comfort zone
            and fail undertaking the journey.
          </p>

          <h2 className="red">Interpretation second dream</h2>

          <p>
            Here we have the dreamer's mother upset with him bringing a girl at home. In the actual life, the dreamer has never
            presented any of his girlfriends to his parents, and a similar scenario where they catch him with a girlfriend 
            which he presents as a friend, did happen. The interesting part is that in his dream, the mother is actually upset
            by finding him with a girl, but his real mother would not behave this way. This is our indication that here we are 
            dealing with a mother complex that was born in the dreamer, and which is unrelated to the real mother. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The dream mother is jealous of the girl. She wants to keep the son all for herself. The mother in a man's dream
            is yet another aspect of the anima, the first form that the anima takes in the life of a boy. Then Jung describes 
            different stages of anima development in the man's life. The first aspect is Eve, representing fertility and sexuality,
            the most primitive aspect of the feminine. Next she gets differentiated into Helen, Mary and Sophia, which represent 
            more refined aspects of the anima. 
          </p>

          <p>
            That the mother aspect of the anima keeps the dreamer in a state of childhood fantasy, could prevent him from developing his anima to a more refined state, and explain why the girl in the dream is someone with 
            whom he had a shallow relationship that revolved around sexuality. In real life, anima development would mean that the dreamer's 
            libido and life impulse is healthy and appropriate for his age.
          </p>

          
          <h2 className="red">Synthesis</h2>

          <p>
            We concluded together that both his dreams refer to hesitations towards going fully into life and maturing, and that 
            the pants and the mother are synonyms refering to a mother complex. Our interpretation was confirmed the next day, when he dreamed that he has a fight
            with his mother that is so bad, one of those fights that lead to a permanent split. In mythical imagery this would be the same 
            as slaying the dragon. It's important to note though that even if the dreamer sees himself doing the right thing, this does not mean 
            yet that the deed is done. He needs to focus on the problem and tackle it actively, otherwise it's likely that the same dream 
            imagery will get repeated, until the problem is actually solved.
