          <h2 className="red">Dream Series</h2>

          <p>
            These dreams occurred one after another over the span of two weeks, all reflecting the dreamer's  
            fears about recent events. Moreover, she engaged with the dream images, asking questions about them,  
            which led to follow-up dreams that provided answers.  
          </p>

          <h2 className="red">Dreams</h2>

          <p>
            <span className="red">20.01.2025</span> - I was in my hometown when I suddenly saw a  
            big spaceship, like a UFO, in the sky. Terrified, I and other people ran and hid inside a building. Then, when  
            I looked at the UFO again, I saw that its window was like a screen displaying the face of Kevin from the  
            movie *Home Alone*. I was crouching down with other people when a child-sized soldier with a gun  
            came at me. I disarmed him easily but handed the gun to a man because I didn't know what to do with it.  
            The man hesitated as well and then shot some tiny soldiers with it. I woke up to the voice of my  
            brother criticizing the man for hesitating and not immediately protecting the woman.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="red">Associations</span> - The dreamer has moved to a new country alone,  
            settling in a home in a village. The frightening UFO with Kevin's face on it made her realize  
            she is scared to be here by herself. Her brother, who recently traveled alone to another  
            continent, represented a more confident, masculine energy to her. However, she wasn't sure  
            whether the image of her brother was positive—symbolizing the right attitude to overcome fear—  
            or if he represented a negative animus repressing valid emotions. This uncertainty  
            came also from the fact that the threatening soldiers in the dream appeared to be children.  

            At the time, the dreamer was also reading a book, and she felt that the author would have  
            encouraged befriending the fear instead. Over the following days, the dreamer is once again crippled 
            by fears of driving, triggered by the challenge of navigating a new country, unfamiliar roads, 
            and having little to no driving experience
          </p>


          <p>
            <span className="red">21.01.2025</span> - I had a German Shepherd. He was attacking an animal, maybe a cow.  
            Then, something like a god appeared on the horizon—huge, covering the whole sky. I think its appearance  
            was that of some sort of bovine as well. The image filled me with awe.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="red">Associations</span> - The dreamer was thinking about the possibility of getting a  
            German Shepherd to make her feel safe so that she could go on hikes alone. This dream was an answer to her  
            thoughts, and it made her realize that the fear she is experiencing is of an archetypal nature and that a dog  
            is not the answer she is seeking. A dog cannot confront God's will and fate. The numinous feeling in the  
            dream made the dreamer feel more connected to something larger than herself.  
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="red">22.01.2025</span> - I was going up the stairs with my brother. I believe it was  
            the staircase of the building where we grew up. My brother was carrying a small water tank with a handle,  
            with no cover on the top, so it was like a basket. Inside the tank, there was a fish that kept trying to bite  
            my brother. I knew the fish would become food, and I was a bit sad because the fish seemed intelligent and sentient.  
            Then the scene changed, and I was swimming underwater with the fish, befriending it. But when the fish wanted  
            to come to me, it would use a sort of harpoon that it threw at me, piercing my skin and pulling itself toward me.  
            I was covered in little wounds from it, but somehow I didn't feel the pain and ignored it. I did wonder what would  
            happen if it got infected, though. Then my brother saw and was very disapproving.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="red">Associations</span> - This dream came as a response to the dreamer's question from  
            the previous dream with her brother: "Is my dream brother's attitude correct, or is it wrong?" This dream  
            begins with an upward movement, which signifies an increase in consciousness. This increase in consciousness  
            is generated by the dreamer's masculine aspect, which keeps a threatening instinct contained. A fish is a  
            more primitive form of life that lives underwater, symbolizing the unconscious psyche. We are shown that the  
            right attitude is to keep it contained and to eat it, which means processing it and integrating it. However, the  
            dreamer tries to befriend the fish, mirroring her thought from the previous dream about whether befriending the fear  
            is, in fact, the right attitude. The dream maker replies that allowing these small fears to come at you may seem harmless  
            for a while, but in time, the body can become infected and sick. The masculine attitude rightfully disapproves.  
            The dreamer thus decides to keep her driving fear contained and take a rational approach to her driving problem.

          <p>
            <span className="red">31.01.2025</span> - I was with a young man at the entrance of a forest,  
            which looked like a cave. The vegetation inside was an intensely vibrant green. The man took  
            a few steps into the forest when we both saw a wolf. It started running toward us, and we fled.  
            At first, I was ahead because I had a head start, but soon, the guy was catching up with me. I  
            thought he would overtake me, but instead, he took my arm and helped me run faster. In my mind,  
            I was preparing how I would defend myself if the wolf caught up with us. I had a large flashlight  
            in my hand and thought I would hit the wolf over the head with it.  

            Then, we arrived at what seemed to be a community. At the front stood a talking bear, who stepped  
            aside to let us in and protect us. Once I was safe, I asked someone what had happened to the wolf.  
            They told me the wolf had been asking around if anyone knew where the snake was.  
            "How did you understand the wolf's language?" I asked.  

            "The wolf spoke in the snake's language," they replied.  

            They then demonstrated it to me, and it sounded like Parseltongue from *Harry Potter*.  
            The wolf had taken over the snake's role of protecting the water creatures.  

            I then used my flashlight to shine it over the wolf and saw it standing at the edge of a lake,  
            near a woman with a crib. It was not hurting her but merely watching over the water. Then I learned  
            that the most vulnerable of all water animals were the birds. There was a group of pigeons, and as  
            I looked at them, I knew it was about them.  

            I then walked away into a narrow street, contemplating the pure joy of connectedness to all that is—  
            the feeling that comes when you try to protect the life around you. To my left, I saw a butcher holding  
            a pigeon that was dead, hanging by its legs. He was pulling its wings off.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="red">Associations</span> - Keeping her fears under control and using a rational  
            approach to her driving fear helped the dreamer tremendously. However, she was now uncertain how  
            she should approach her fear of going for walks alone in nature. She wanted to know what her  
            unconscious thought about this when she had this dream.  
            <br/><br/>
            The forest is another way to represent the unconscious psyche, and the deep green represents  
            the intensity with which the dreamer experiences life itself. It is from this vibrant place that  
            the threatening wolf comes. The dreamer could associate the wolf with fear because, in this dream,  
            she is imagining how she could defend herself against it, just as she had previously imagined  
            what she would do if she were attacked while walking alone.  
            <br/><br/>
            The dreamer is not confronting the fear but rather trying to escape it, which, in psychological  
            terms, means that she feels attacked by her own emotions and is trying to fight them off.  
            Then we see that safety comes in the form of this community. This once more reflects the  
            dreamer's own thoughts that community, friends, and family allow one to feel safe from threats.  
            <br/><br/>
            That the bear is at the head of this group and playing a protective role is particularly  
            interesting, since the dreamer is afraid of bears due to the many bear attacks she's heard  
            about on the news. So, it is as if an aspect of the dreamer's own instinctive capacity for  
            aggression and community helps against the threat.  
            <br/><br/>
            Then the dreamer inquires about the wolf and finds out the wolf is defending the water life.  
            Once more, the water represents all that is unconscious and life itself. Birds are creatures  
            that fly, so they represent our desire to fly free, to explore. The dreamer also thinks of  
            pigeons as the less intelligent type of bird that frequently gets hurt by human means.  
            <br/><br/>
            That the wolf is temporarily replacing the snake indicates that the fear instinct is a substitute  
            for a more primal type of instinct. Snakes stand for the sympathetic nervous system. To be defended  
            by our inner snake would mean feeling in our body when something is wrong. This would be a more  
            advanced type of self-defense than creating fearful scenarios in one's mind to keep oneself from harm.  
            <br/><br/>
            The unconscious encourages the dreamer to get to know this fear instinct well by flashing a light on  
            it and recognizes it as something beneficial. As shown at the end of the dream, this fear comes from  
            a deeper aspect of the dreamer that tries to protect life itself. However, the dream also warns that  
            the impulse for freedom can lead to very tragic ends.

          <p>
            These dreams are a good example of the dialogue that can occur between the ego and the  
            unconscious when the ego pays attention to dreams. Here, we can see that the unconscious  
            adapts its advice to the problem at hand.  
            <br/><br/>
            For the dreamer's fears of being home alone in a new country and driving, the unconscious  
            suggests that these fears should be contained and tightly regulated. However, the fear of hiking  
            was portrayed as a benevolent force aimed at keeping the dreamer safe.  
            <br/><br/>
            Dreams tend to repeat themselves, presenting the same problem in different images,  
            until the ego's attitude shifts. But, as seen here, actively engaging with dream images  
            can speed up this process and lead to profound feelings of connectedness to the Self.
