          It is a tough exercise of imagination to escape their invisible
          chains. Without realizing it, you move in circles just the way they
          dictate. And how could you do anything else?
        </p>

        <p>
          You were born into weakness, between 4 concrete walls, away from the
          earth and the animals that your ancestors came into contact every day
          as their source of life. They put you into a box, took all your power
          and slowly introduced more and more ways of control. You were a child
          when 5 hours of your day were forcefully taken without you or your
          parents having any choice about it, soon those hours turned 8, to get
          you used to what will come.
