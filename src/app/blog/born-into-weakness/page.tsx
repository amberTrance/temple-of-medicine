          It’s difficult to escape their invisible chains. We move in circles
          and how could we do anything else but that? We were trained to be
          weak, born surrounded by four walls and away from the earth and the
          animals that gave our ancestors meaning and life. They put us in boxes
          and progressively introduced more and more ways of control. We are
          only children when five hours of our day are forcefully taken away
          without us or our parents having any choice about it. Soon those five
          hours turn into eight to train us for what will come.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we do not pick our food from the rich ground that replenishes
          itself, but through a piece of paper, then we are their slaves. We
          have to dance the way they sing and we learn than in order to survive
          we need the paper, and to make the paper we need a profession. After a
          few years of assiduous work we can afford to buy a house, for the
          lucky ones! But during all that time our personal dreams and our
          creative selves were tossed aside, but few ever notice it because this
          is the state in which we are born so it feels as normal as breathing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Someone telling us what to do is every day normality and we are not
          even aware of it. We think we are free, but the whole educational
          system is about doing what they tell us, and later so is our job and
          this is the biggest chunk of our waking hours. We almost forget we’re
          individuals endowed with full capacity to live as we envision it. They
          don’t allow us to. They created a system in which we need to move as
          they say or we die. We don’t even realize that at the back of our mind
          is the fear of having no roof above the head, nothing to eat, homeless
          and isolated. We don’t realize how abnormal and unnatural this image
          is, coming from the human animal which evolved to live and strive in
          groups that work together and support one another.

          The more one thinks about it, the scarier it gets. Is it a coincidence
          that the structure of society today is that of families as the largest
          groups? And even those become smaller and more unreliable. All too
          often individuals die alone, found in their apartment decomposing or
          half eaten by a starving pet. So let’s just put old people in asylums
          without realizing that this problem did not exist for the most of this
          humanity’s existence.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what can we do, you may ask. What are the options? How can we
          shake off their conditioning and the limitations that now build up the
          whole of society? The answer is inside of you. If you drop all
          pretense, if you become fully honest with yourself and willing to face
          your fears, instinct will slowly tell you what is right for you and
          what you may do to exit the system and start thriving rather than just
          existing.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is difficult to drop the chains but it doesn’t need to be something
          we achieve over the night. It may take years of slow but decisive
          work, particularly inner work. Because the conscious mind alone is an
          easy victim to all these external influences. A good example are
          inspiring individuals that speak up about many of these problems yet
          they themselves fall prey to the system rather than move in their own
          unique direction. These people that become very successful speaking
          about the liberation of the human soul on YouTube, playing the
          algorithm using click-bait titles, offering expensive trainings or
          putting an add every 10 minutes of their video presentations, these
          people are still actors in the grand play that enslaves us all. The
          only difference is that they hold a privileged role. You can feel in
          their drive for money, success and influence that somewhere on the
          road the pure authentic intention was lost.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you audition for those roles, you do nothing else but play their
          game. But what can we do to destroy it? It’s one of the hardest tasks
          that there are, to figure it out. It takes a lot of courage to
          confront all the fear they unconsciously instilled in us and the heavy
          work of going deep within to find out what our soul actually wants
          from us. I believe each of us is a beautiful and unique individual
          that has something to offer to the rest of the world, it doesn’t
          matter how big or small. And we can bring this back to the world. We
          can support one another and we don’t need anyone to tell us how and
          when we can do it.
        </p>

        <p>
          We need to break our chains and to exit this virtual reality we find
          ourselves in. We can see many signs of increasing dystopia, such as
          their plan to remove cash money and make it all digital. This way it
          becomes even easier to dictate how you should move when our bank
          accounts can be frozen anytime they wish. And I do not need to tell
          you how this world is going down, I am sure you think about it very
          often yourself. So let us fight to release ourselves and find back our
          humanity.
