          When we’re children we don’t play and explore the world ever thinking
          about how our actions make us feel like ‘someone’. We’re simply
          natural, full of wonder and joy. Sometimes along the way, gradually,
          we learn that our actions have consequences for our ego.

          One day when I was six, I took my mother to the store to buy me
          candies. Little did she know that it was not the candy I was after. My
          mother was a kindergarten teacher and I was in her class. When we
          arrived, I went to the toilet and I took out from my bag one candy, a
          red one. Then I licked the candy and rubbed it to my lips to make the
          colour stick to them. I felt neglected by the kids in the class so I
          wanted to be pretty, I wanted to be seen.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started drawing and enjoyed it dearly since I was little. By the
          time I was twelve, when I transferred from a regular school to the
          arts school, I was still drawing every day. I liked to draw humans,
          mostly women whom I would dress up in clothes I imagined. I would also
          reproduce illustrations from children’s books. While my mother would
          encourage me all the time, I don’t think it mattered too much, I drew
          simply because I liked it. The first three years in art school the
          natural passion was still there, although after I started art classes
          I never made a single drawing any more at home, except for homework.
          An important reason for this is that I learned that there are rules
          for drawing and this stifled my courage and impulse to draw whatever I
          wanted. When the professor saw my drawings collection, one of the
          first things he said to me: the proportions of these models is wrong.
          Well, you see, my drawings were never meant to be like the magazine
          models. I didn’t think about it and I didn’t care, but his words
          affected me.

          Fast forward, in middle school we would draw a lot from static nature
          but in high school we were required all the time to make compositions
          from our imagination. I was never good at that so I felt a serious
          inhibition during these years. I was looking around and envying those
          who are still passionate about it. I was skilled though, so I did go
          in a national contest to represent my city. There I met a boy and one
          day I saw him sit down and draw things unrelated to the contest. I was
          so impressed that he had the impulse to draw even when not required. I
          felt ashamed of myself.

          Another instance that stuck to my mind until today was when I had a
          conversation with this friend of mine. She once said to me that I’m
          not talented, that Mary is. Those words convey perfectly the topic I
          am approaching today, the pervasive cultural learning that what you do
          represents you, and it raises you or lowers you. Frequently someone
          else’s drive and creation will be showcased against yours.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the age of seventeen, I had a long time of subliminal learning that
          how I look like, what I do and how talented I am matters in the eyes
          of others. I learned that I will be judged and compared with others. I
          learned that what I do represents me, and that if I don’t do anything
          I am no one and I have no worth.
        </p>

        <p>
          I gave up art. My tendency to introspect, think and analyze made me
          choose psychology for university studies. During those years I felt
          the same sense of emptiness and need to prove myself. I would be
          secretly jealous of my friend who’d watch more documentaries than me.
          At some point I picked up art again and before I would even finish a
          drawing, I would imagine that I give it to him and I would receive his
          appreciation in return. I never finished the drawing.

          Then I encountered Carl Jung’s work and it completely changed my life.
          It is from him that I have heard fom the first time about the Self,
          the inner God that expresses itself through us. He would make the
          point that our little ego is nothing, that all energy, power and
          creation comes from something beyond us, greater than us. That we
          should be in reverie and respect towards this flow of life and not
          attribute its expression to our ego. That the ego should be humble.
          This has been one of the greatest gifts I have ever received. It
          liberated me.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I look inside myself, I see very well that I am not the origin of
          any curiosity or creative impulse that comes out of me. I had years in
          my life where I felt complete apathy towards things that before would
          spark fireworks inside my heart and soul. I could not merely snap my
          fingers and make it come back. I was a tiny ego that could only go
          down that unknown world and explore the intricacies of why the flow of
          life in me stopped. And one day, my exploration paid off. The river is
          now flowing, full of energy and passion, and it is not my river. I
          take no personal, ego pride in it. The moment I would start to do
          that, the river would desiccate and die.
        </p>

          I have heard many wonderful artists speak about it. I recall in one
          video hearing John Frusciante, the guitar player of Red Hot Chilly
          Peppers, saying that there is no such thing as ‘Kurt Cobain’ (insert
          any artist name), there is only art, music. He deeply understood that
          it’s not about the person, not about the ego, that creation is
          something profound and sacred that flows through us as a gift, or it
          doesn’t. The moment you accept this it will change your life.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s liberating to let the music in your mind flow out through your
          voice or instrument, the excitement of touching the canvas with your
          brush strokes, of writing down a thought, of exploring the world of
          plants, or anything else that excites your imagination and joy to be
          alive, without judging it. If someone likes what you do, is
          indifferent to it, or hates it, it doesn’t matter because it’s not
          about you. You should be the faithful servant of forces greater than
          you, that speak through you all the time as long as you acknowledge
          it. When you will realize this, you will have gained real joy and
          freedom.

          In fact, here is a good example. I didn’t start writing this blog
          thinking about what sort of reactions I will get, how many people will
          read it, how great they will think I am, or I’m not. The moment I
          would start to think that way the impulse would die. So instead, I can
          say that I am doing this project because it excites me and there is
          the chance that my study of dreams may benefit someone out there. I do
          it because I am in love with the thought that each of us can let the
          river of life flow through them and we can bring out its fruit, in the
          open, for all of us to share in it. We could really transform humanity
          If all of us would have the courage to do it.
